**ABSTRACT**
Using equivariant localization on the moduli space of stable maps, it is known how to calculate equivariant Gromov—Witten invariants of GKM spaces by summing over certain decorated trees. I will explain how to do this solely in terms of the GKM graph and introduce a new tool implementing these calculations. Example applications include GW invariants of local models of non-isolated P1’s in 3-space, some equivariant quantum products of Tolman/Eschenburg/Woodward’s twisted flag manifold, as well as equivariant Seidel elements / shift operators. Joint work with Giosuè Muratore.

T-space $X$ is GKM if
- $X^T$ is finite
- $X$ is equivariantly formal
- weights of $T_pX$ at each $p\in X^T$ are pairwise linearly independent

GKM graph 
- vertices are $X^T$, 
- edges -> 1-dimensional orbit
- weights - to each $e=(p,q)$ edge assign $T$-weight of $T_pC_e$ , giving a function $\alpha$?

quantum coefficient ring

twisted flag manifold $X=SU(3)/T^2$, $(s,t)A=\begin{pmatrix}s^2t^2&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}A\begin{pmatrix}\overline{s}&0&0\\0&\overline{t}&0\\0&0&\overline{st}\end{pmatrix}$??
