**ABSTRACT**
A topological space is rationally elliptic if the sum of the ranks over Q of the homotopy groups and the cohomology groups is finite. IÂ  will describe the background, results and conjectures on classification of rationally elliptic smooth and singular algebraic varieties following my recent preprint: "Families of singular algebraic varieties that are rationally elliptic spaces".

---

rational homotopy group can be described in terms of minimal model

construction of singular algebraic variety which is rationally elliptic

>[!done] Example
>- simply connected $G/K$ is r. elliptic, $G$ - connected Lie group, $K$ - closed subgroup
>- $\mathbb{P}^n$, smooth quadrics, Grassmanians
>- Elienberg MacLane $K(\pi, i)$ - r.e., $i\geq 2$ and $\pi$ is abelian
>- topological spaces with a finite Postnikov tower
>- $E\xrightarrow{F} B$ Serre fibration $\implies$ (two of the spaces are r.e. $\implies$ the third one also)

>[!info] Theorem
>$n=\max H^i(X,\mathbb{Q})$, $\pi_*(X)=\oplus\pi_i(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}$, $H^*(X)=\oplus H^i(X, \mathbb{Q})$ 
>- $\pi_i(X)=0$, $i\geq 2n$
>- $rank(\pi_*(X)\)\leq n$
>- $\dim H^*(X)$ something :p

Hilali conjecture:  rational elliptic $\implies$ $\dim \pi_*(X)\leq\dim H^*(X, \mathbb{Q})$

he uses sectional curvature to say when something is rational elliptic

non-negative sectional curvature $\implies$ $T_X$ is nef $\implies$ $(-1)^p\chi^p\geq0$ --- what is nef? (a tangent bundle can be nef?)

Cox construction

$X$ - smooth complex analytic surface simply connected and rationally elliptic
- $\mathbb{P}^2$
- Hirzebrch surface $S(h)=\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(h))$, $h\neq0$
- 1-connected surface of general tpe such that $p_g=0$ and $c_1^2=8$ and $c_2=4$ (fake quadric)

Fano manifold
