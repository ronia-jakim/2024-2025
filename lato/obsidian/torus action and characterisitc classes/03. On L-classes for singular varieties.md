**ABSTRACT**
Several characteristic classes of manifolds have their counterparts in the singular case. In fact, there are often different characteristic classes for singular varieties that recover the same class in the smooth case. In this talk, we will discuss various L-classes for singular varieties, how they are related, and their connection to rational homology manifolds. The talk is based on joint works with J. Fernández de Bobadilla and M. Saito.
