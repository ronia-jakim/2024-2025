**ABSTRACT**
We introduce several generalisations of certain combinatorial models called pipe dreams, namely generic pipe dreams and hybrid pipe dreams, and show how they compute equivariant cohomology classes of the lower-upper varieties of Knutson, and equivariant CSM classes of Schubert cells and related spaces. If time permits, we'll discuss the extension to K-theory. This is joint work with A. Knutson.
