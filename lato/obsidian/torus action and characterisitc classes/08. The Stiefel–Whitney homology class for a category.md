**ABSTRACT**
From homotopy theory viewpoint, Tom Leinster (2008) introduced the notion of Euler characteristic for a finite category (that has been generalized to the theory of magnitude,Â  nowadays). It would be natural to ask what is 'integration with respect to that Euler characteristic measure' ? Also in a similar purely combinatorial context with finite categories, we discuss about a counterpart to the (Sullivan's) Stiefel-Whitney homology class.
