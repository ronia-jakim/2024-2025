**ABSTRACT**
We recall a generalization of matrix Schubert varieties to the rectangular case, and study their conormal varieties. Under a 321-avoiding assumption (that we'll motivate), we give a formula for the classes of these varieties as a sum over "Temperley-Lieb pipe dreams". Each of these uses only bump tiles and upside-down bump tiles, and has a nonlocal contribution based on 2 to the number of closed loops. This is joint with Paul Zinn-Justin.

Matrix Schubert varieties have another generalization: consider the finitely many B_{2n}-orbit closures on {M in Mat_2n, M^2 = 0}. I describe work in progress on a pipe dream formula for these, which again involves closed loops unless the orbit lies inside upper triangular matrices. This is joint work in progress with a big crowd at McMaster University.

pipe dreams for matrix schubert varieties

CSM classes (again)
D-modules
$D_M$ = functions times, composites of functions, differential operators from vector fields
sheaf of algebras D_M -> M
$D_M$ acts on $T^*M$ and we get a graded module (maybe after filtration?)
Heisenberg relation

$\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^*}=\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}]=D_\mathbb{C}x^{-1}$ -> you can differentiate to get negative powers and multiply by $x$ to get positive powers
