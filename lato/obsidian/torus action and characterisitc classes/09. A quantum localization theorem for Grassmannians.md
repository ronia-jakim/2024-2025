**ABSTRACT**
The Yang-Baxter algebra arising in the study of a five-vertex lattice model is given by relations of the form RTT=TTR, where R is the R-matrix, and T is the transfer matrix. These may be regarded as operators acting on the direct sum of torus-equivariant (quantum) K theory rings of the Grassmannians of linear subspaces in C^n. In joint work with V. Gorbounov and C. Korff, we give geometric interpretations for R and T in terms of operators in the equivariant quantum K theory ring of Grassmannians, and related 'quantum=classical' convolutions. For example, the R-matrix gives the left Weyl group action, and the quantum trace of T gives the quantum K multiplication by the lambda_y class of the dual of the quotient bundle. As an application, we obtain a quantum version of the localization theorem, where the fixed point classes are quantized to the eigenvectors of the quantum trace of T.
