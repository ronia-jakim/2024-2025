**ABSTRACT**
It has been known since the work of Quillen that cohomology theories with a theory of Chern classes give rise to (and are often determined by) a formal group law governing the behaviour of the first Chern class of line bundles under tensor product.The chromatic picture organises such cohomology theories according to the height of their formal group laws. The additive, multiplicative and elliptic formal group laws all relate to cohomology theories with Chern classes, namely cohomology, K-theory and various elliptic cohomology theories. When a torus action is added into the picture, it becomes more intuitive, and the geometry of the elliptic theory is finally emerging. These developments coincide with a range of applications in new settings. I will attempt to give an overview over these recent developments.
