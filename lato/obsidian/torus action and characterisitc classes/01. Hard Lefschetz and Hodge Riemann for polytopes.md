**ABSTRACT**
The lecture is a survey on previous results obtained in collaboration with Gottfried Barthel, Karl-Heinz Fieseler and Ludger Kaup (BBFK) and on results by Karl-Heinz Fieseler. Although these results may be considered "old", the techniques and methods are still current and likely to be used for further works. For non-simple polytopes, Stanley defined a generalized $h$-vector, using properties of intersection cohomology of general projective toric varieties. In order to prove the conjectured properties of this generalized $h$-vector various authors introduced a purely combinatorial virtual intersection cohomology for polytopes, inspired by equivariant intersection cohomology of projective toric varieties. Using Hodge-Riemann relations, this construction leads to the proof of a combinatorial Hard Lefschetz theorem.

simplicial polytope -> each face is a simplex
simple polytope -> each vertex has the same degree equal to dimension of the space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in which it is immersed (octahedron is not because it is in $\mathbb{R}^3$ but it has $4$ edges to each vertex)

polytope simple $\iff$ dual simplicial

**Dehn-Sommerville equation**
$$(-1)^{n-1}f_k=\sum_{j=k}^{n-1}(-1)^j\begin{pmatrix}j+1\\k+1\end{pmatrix}f_j$$
relating number of $k$-dimensional faces to the number of higher dimensional faces

$F(P, t)=t^{n+1}F(P^o, 1/t)$ relation between the f-polynomial of polytop $P$ and its dual $P^o$

$h$-vector 
$$h_k=\sum_{i=0}^k(-1)^{k-i}\begin{pmatrix}n-i\\k-i\end{pmatrix}f_{i-1}$$
better to use $h$-polynomial than $f$-polynomial

from Dehn-Sommerville $h_k=h_{n-k}$

for a simple convex $n$-dim polytope
$$h_k=\sum_{i\geq k}f_i(-1)^{i-k}\begin{pmatrix}i\\k\end{pmatrix}$$
$h(P, t)=f(P, t-1)$ relation between $h$-polynomial and $f$-polynomial

$n$-tetrahedon, $n$-hexahedron
$h_j=1$, $h_j=\begin{pmatrix}n\\ j\end{pmatrix}$ (not sure about the second one)

Theorem McMullen conjecture
- Dehj-Sommervile equations and symmetry
- unimodality $1=h_0\leq...$
- specific estimates for the growth $h_{i+1}-h_i\leq (h_i-h_{i-1})^{<i>}$, where $h^{<i>}=\begin{pmatrix}n_i+1\\i+1\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}n_{i-1}+1\\i\end{pmatrix}+...$ and $h=\begin{pmatrix}n_i\\i\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}n_{i-1}\\i-1\end{pmatrix}+....+\begin{pmatrix}n_j\\j\end{pmatrix}$, $h$ a positive integer can be written uniquely as

outer normal fan of a polynomial $\Delta(P)$: for each face take the normal vector and take a semi-line from $0$ in the direction of this vector
it determines a projective toric variety $X_{\Delta(P)}$ 

proof of MacMuller
1. simple rational polytope
	- $\Delta(P)$ is simplicial, toric variety is rational homology manifold
	- poincare polynomial agrees with $h(t^2)$ 
		- symmetry is poincare dualit, 
		- positivity and unimodality comes from Hard Lefschetz theorem, 
		- growth conditions from the cohomology algebra $H^*(X_{\Delta(P)})$ by elements of degree $2$
2. simple non-rational polytope
	- no rational toric variety
	- we cannot work with poincare and cohohmolgy
	- instead we associate to $P$ a "virtual" cohomology algebra $H^*(\Delta(P))$ with Hilbert polynomial $h(t^2)$
		- $V$-ambient space of $\Delta(P)$ ($P$ lives in $V^*$)
		- $A=S(V^*)$ algebra of polynomial functions on $V$
		- homogeneous max ideal of all polynomials vanishing at $0$, $\mathfrak{m}$
		- for graded module $M$ denoted $\overline{M}=(A/\mathfrak{m})\otimes_AM$
		- $A_{\Delta(P)}$ - graded $A$-module of all conewise polynomial functions and
			$$H^*(\Delta(P))=\overline{A}_{\Delta(P)}=(A/\mathfrak{m})\otimes_AA_{\Delta(P)},$$
			then $h_k=\dim H^k(\Delta(P))$
3. non-simple rational polytope
	- outer fan is not simplicial
	- toric variaty is not rational homology manifold
	- Betti numbers nor $h$-vector of $P$ are not as fan as previously
	- intersection homology $h_k=\dim IH^*(X_{\Delta(P)}\mathbb{Q})$ ???????????
	- no natural algebra structure on $IH^*(X_{\Delta(P)})$ so no proof of growth estimate, no connection between $h$ polynomial and face polynomial
	- stanlee -> small pertrubations without changing combinatorics but smoothness is OK?????
4. non-simple non-rational
	- "virtual" intersection cohomology as in the case of simple non-rational polytopes
	- sheaf -> subfans $\Lambda\subseteq\Delta$ are open, define $\Lambda\mapsto A_\Lambda$ in particular $A_\sigma=\mathcal{A}(\sigma)=S(V_\sigma^*)$ ($V_\sigma:=span(\sigma)$)
	- sheaf of graded $\mathcal{A}$-modules is **pure** if 
		- for each cone $\sigma$ the restriction to boundary $F_\sigma\to F_{\partial \sigma}$ is surjective
		- each $\sigma\in\Delta$ $F_\sigma=\mathcal{F}_\sigma$ is finitely generated and free
	- unique minimal $\varepsilon$ determined by $\overline{E}_\sigma\to\overline{E}_{\partial \sigma}$ is even 
	- $\varepsilon$ is called the equivariant intersection homology sheaf of $\Delta$ and $IH^*(\Delta)=\overline{E}_\Delta$

Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations
$$IH^{n-k}(\Delta)\times IH^{n-k}(\Delta)\to\mathbb{R}$$
McMullen proved for simple polytopes
