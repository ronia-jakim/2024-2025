A linear function 
$$\phi:E\to\mathbb{R},$$
where $(E,\|\cdot\|)$ is a normed space over $\mathbb{R}$, is called a **functional**. If $\phi$ is continuous, then it is bounded on 
$$B_E=\{v\in E\;:\;\|v\|\leq1\}.$$ 
A **norm of a continuous functional** is defined as
$$\|\phi\|=\sup_{v\in B_E}|\phi(v)|<\infty.$$

Any measure defines a functional on the space of all bounded continuous functions on $X$, $C_b(X)$, by integration:
$$\mu:C_b(X)\to\mathbb{R}\quad \mu(g)=\int_X gd\mu.$$

>Let $\mu,\nu\in P(X)$, then 
>$$[(\forall\;g\in C_b(X))\;\mu(g)=\nu(g)]\implies\mu=\nu.$$

>[!info] simplified Riesz representation theorem
>Let $K$ be a compact metrizable space and $\phi:C(K)\to\mathbb{R}$ be a norm-one positive functional. Then there is a unique $\mu\in P(K)$ which represents $\phi$, i.e.
>$$\phi(g)=\int_K gd\mu\;\forall\;g\in C(K)$$

We will not want measure convergence that is pointwise, that is $(\forall\;B\in Bor(X))\;\mu_n(B)\to \mu(B)$. Instead, we want convergence as functionals:

>[!tip] convergence of measures
>$\mu_n\to \mu$ if they converge as functionals on $C_b(X)$
>$$\mu_n(g)=\int_Xgd\mu_n\to \int_Xgd\mu=\mu(g)$$
>for any $g\in C_b(X)$.

A measure $\mu\in P(X)$ is 
- **continuous** if for every $x\in X$ we have $\mu(\{x\})=0$
- **discrete** if $\mu$ is concentrated on some countable set.
A continuous measure can converge to a discrete measure and vice versa.

>[!info] equivalent conditions for convergence
>The following are equivalent

>- $\lim\sup\mu_n(F)\leq\mu(F)$ for every closed $F\subseteq X$
>- $\lim\inf\mu_n(V)\geq\mu(V)$ for every open $V\subseteq X$
>- $\lim\mu_n(B)=\mu(B)$ for every Borel set havind $\mu$-null boundary
