## FACTS ABOUT CANTOR SET
- is a compact space in product topology
- metrizable, e.g. $d(x,y)=\frac{1}{k}$, where $k$ is the first place where $x(k)\neq y(k)$, is a compatible metric
- zerodimensional, i.e. has a base of clopen sets
- $h:2^\mathbb{N}\to[0,1]$, $h(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty x(n)\cdot 2^{-n}$ is a contninuous surjection 
- *every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set*
- $2^\mathbb{N}$ with addition module $2$ on each coordinate is a *topological group*

>[!tip] set determined by coordinates
>For $I\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ we say that $A$ is determined by coordinates in $I$, $A\sim I$, if
>$$(\forall\;x\in A)(\forall\;y\in2^\mathbb{N})\;x|I=y|I\implies y\in A$$

Equivalently, $A=\pi_I^{-1}(\pi_I(A))$, where $\pi_I:2^\mathbb{N}\to 2^I$ is the projection onto coordinates of $I$.


**Lemma.** $A\subseteq 2^\mathbb{N}$ is clopen $\iff$ $A\sim I$ for some $|I|<\infty$.

## probability measure on Cantor set

> [!tip]
> If $C\sim I$, we can write $C=C'\times 2^{\mathbb{N}-I}$ and put
> $$\nu(C)=\frac{|C'|}{|I|}.$$
> This is a well-defined measure on $Clop(2^\mathbb{N})$ and it extends to a measure on $Bor(2^\mathbb{N})=\sigma(Clop(2^\mathbb{N}))$.

>[!info] $\nu$ is the Haar measure
>The measure $\nu$ is the unique probability measure which is **translation invariant**, $\nu(B\oplus x)=\nu(B)$ for all $B\in Bor(2^\mathbb{N})$ and $x\in2^\mathbb{N}$.

>[!tip] tail set
>We say that $A\subseteq 2^\mathbb{N}$ is a **tail set** if it does not depend on a finite number of coordinates, in other words:
>$$(\forall\;k\in\mathbb{N})\;A\sim\{k, k+1,...\}.$$

Every tail set has measure $1$ or $0$. This is Kolmogorov's 0-1 theorem.

$$A(\beta)=\{x\in 2^\mathbb{N}\;:\;\lim\frac{x(1)+...+x(n)}{n}=\beta\}$$
is a tail set because changing the first few coordinates does not affect this limit drastically.

>[!warning] laws of large numbers
>**Weak law of large numbers:** if $X_n$ are a collection of identically distributed random variables, then
>$$(\forall\;\varepsilon>0)\;\lim\text{Prob}(|\frac{1}{n}\sum X_k - \mathbb{E}X_1 |<\varepsilon)=1$$
>meaning that the mean of $X_n$ converges to their expected value in probability.
>
>**Strong law of large numbers:** if $X_n$ are a collection of identically distributed random variables, then
>$$\text{Prob}(\lim \frac{1}{n}\sum X_k=\mathbb{E}X_1)=1$$
>meaning that the mean of $X_n$ converges to their expected value almost surely.
