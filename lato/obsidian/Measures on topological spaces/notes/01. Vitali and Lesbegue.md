Given the space $X$, write $\mathbb{P}(X)$ (or as Plebanek - $P(X)$) for the family of all probability measures defined on $Bor(X)$.

**Lemma.** If $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is a measurable set, $0<\lambda(A)<\infty$, then for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is a nonempty interval $(a,b)$ such that 
$$\frac{\lambda(A\cap (a,b))}{b-a}>1-\varepsilon$$

> [!tip] density point
> $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is a density point of $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ if 
> $$\lim_{\delta\to 0}\frac{\lambda(A\cap (x-\delta, x+\delta))}{2\delta}=1$$

This means that very small strips around $x$ are basically full.
Almost every (everything except a set of measure zero) point of a measurable set is its density point.


> [!tip] Vitali cover
> A family $\mathcal{J}$ of nondegenerate closed intervals is a **Vitaly cover** of a set $A$ if
> $$(\forall\;x\in A)(\forall\;\varepsilon>0)(\exists J\in\mathcal{J})\;x\in J\;\land\;\text{diam}(J)<\varepsilon$$

This is a covering made out of arbitrary small sets.

> [!tip] Vitali theorem
> If $\mathcal{J}$ is a Vitali cover of $A$, then there exist pairwise disjoint sets $J_n\in\mathcal{J}$ such that 
> $$\lambda(A-\bigcup J_n)=0$$
